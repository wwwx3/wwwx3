## About me
I’m Chatnatda Ovatanupat (Winnie). <br>
I believe engineering is not just about writing code or building machines; it is about understanding people, their problems, and designing systems that can truly help. My interest in technology grew from curiosity, but it became a purpose when I started working on real-world problems in healthcare, robotics, and environmental sustainability.

Through projects like KNEEDEE (AI for knee health), autonomous agricultural robotics, and data-driven applications for public health, I have learned how engineering can be used as a tool for care, whether that means supporting doctors, reducing pollution, or improving everyday life. I enjoy working through challenges and real users, because that is where meaningful innovation happens.

I am especially interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence, biomedical technology, and secure cyber-physical systems. I’m always looking for ways to make technology more responsible, reliable, and human-centered.

**This GitHub is a record of that journey: experiments, prototypes, research, and systems I’ve built while learning how to turn ideas into real, working technology.**
